# Cartoview Installation | Docker

## Introduction
This document describes the installation of Cartoview using Docker on either [Ubuntu 18.04](#for-ubuntu-1804) or [Windows 10](#for-windows-10).

## Installation Requirements

#### For Ubuntu 18.04:

- **Install Docker**

***

In order to be able to run Cartoview with docker engine, Docker Compose should be installed, but because it relies on Docker Engine, we will install ``docker`` first from [Docker official website][1].

1. Install **Docker Engine**, navigate to [this guide][2]. We recommend to install it using [docker repository][3].

2. Install **Docker Compose**, navigate to [this guide][4].

[1]: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
[2]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
[3]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository
[4]: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

!!! note
    The Docker daemon needs to use root privileges, so we must prefix each docker command with ``sudo``, but if you want to run them without ``sudo``, check [How to manage Docker as a non-root user][5].
    
[5]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user

**Validate Docker Installation**

To make sure Docker is installed successfully, run the following command.
```shell
docker --version
# Docker version 19.03.8, build afacb8b
docker-compose --version
# docker-compose version 1.25.4, build 8d51620a
```

- **Install Python2.7 and Django**

***

In order to run Cartoview, we need to install python and django.

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-django
```

#### For Windows 10:

- **Install Docker**

***

Docker has two applications, you can use one of them:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. **[Docker Desktop](#using-docker-desktop)** but it has [specific system requirements][6] that must be met.

[6]: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#system-requirements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. **[Docker Toolbox](#using-docker-toolbox)** which is used for systems that do not meet the requirements of Docker Desktop.

###### Using Docker Desktop:

Walk through this guide to download and install [Docker Desktop][7].

[7]: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

!!! warning
    Before installing Docker Desktop, please read carefully the [What to know before you install][8] section.
    
[8]: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#what-to-know-before-you-install

Proceed with installation and leave everything as default.

After installing docker desktop, we need to start it. In the search-bar, search for **Docker**, and select **Docker Desktop** in the search results.

When the whale icon in the taskbar stays steady, **Docker Desktop** is up-and-running, and is accessible from any terminal window.

!!! note
    If you right-click on the whale icon, you can check multiple features like docker version, docker hub, dashboard, etc.
    
    ![Docker Whale](../img/installation/Docker/whale_icon.png)
    
**Docker Dashboard** provides a useful interface to handle and control all the available containers easily. Please visit [Docker Desktop Dashboard][9] for more details.

[9]: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/dashboard/

***
**Optional | Configure Docker Resources**

You may want to change the default resources given to Docker to speed up operations that will be done on the containers.

Right-click on the whale icon, select **Settings**, navigate to **Resources** tab and change the resources as you wish.

![Docker Resources](../img/installation/Docker/docker_resources.png)
***

###### Using Docker Toolbox:

Walk through this guide to download and install [Docker Toolbox][10] untill you got the terminal in which we will execute the following commands.

[10]: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/

!!! note
    **Docker Toolbox** by default, is configured to use IP address ``192.168.99.100`` so instead of using ``localhost`` we will use this IP address.
    

After installing one of the docker applications above, Validate Docker Installation by opening ``Windows PowerShell`` and execute the following command:

**Validate Docker Installation**

After installing one of the docker applications above, validate docker installation by checking its version.

At any directory, ``right-click with left-Shift`` on the free space and select ``Open Windows PowerShell here``.

This will open a terminal in which we will execute all the upcoming commands. Just copy-paste the commands and hit the Enter button.

```shell
docker --version
# Docker version 19.03.8, build afacb8b
docker-compose --version
# docker-compose version 1.25.4, build 8d51620a
```

The version should be something like what is after the ``#`` symbol.

- **Install Python2.7 and Django**

***

As explained in [Cartoview Installation | Windows](/installation/windows/#installation-requirements) section, download and install [Python2.7][11]. 

[11]: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.17/python-2.7.17.amd64.msi

Open ``Windows PowerShell`` and install django.

```shell
pip install django==1.11.11
```

## Cartoview Libraries Installation

- **Download and Install Cartoview**

***

Download the latest version of cartoview by cloning the repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cartologic/cartoview.git
```

This will create a directory called ``cartoview``.

Navigate inside it to install Cartoview using docker.

!!! warning
    Before executing the command below, make sure that ``port 80`` is not used by any process as Cartoview will be running on it.
    
```shell
cd cartoview
docker-compose up -d
```

!!! warning
    **For Ubuntu**, if you didn't configure docker to run without ``sudo``, make sure to prefix each docker command with it.
    
Get a cup of coffee and wait untill all the images are downloaded and installed successfully.

!!! warning
    **For Docker Desktop**, while installation, you may be prompted to accept whether to give permission for Docker to mount its containers on one of your hard-drives or to not. Accept this so that the containers can run probably.
    
    If you didn't accept, you will get errors. Execute ``docker-compose up -d`` again and accept.
    
After all images are downloaded, you can monitor the logs of initiating Cartoview with this command.

```shell
docker-compose logs -f --tail=100
```

**For Windows Docker Desktop**

If you open **Docker Dashboard**, you should find the installed containers up and running.

![Cartoview on Docker](../img/installation/Docker/cartoview_docker.PNG)

Also, you can see the logs by just ``double-click`` on ``cartoview``.

![Cartoview Logs](../img/installation/Docker/cartoview_logs.png)

- **Migrate & Load default data**

*** 

We need to execute some commands to the service after it's up and running. So we will open the terminal inside ``Cartoview`` container.

**For Ubuntu:**

```shell
docker exec -it cartoview_cartoview_1 /bin/bash
```

**For Windows:**

Open **Docker Dashboard** and for ``cartoview_cartoview_1`` container, click on the Cli button to open the terminal in which we will execute the below commands.

![Cartoview CLI](../img/installation/Docker/cartoview_cli.PNG)

This will open a shell inside the container in which we will execute the following commands.

Detect changes in the ``app_manager``.
```shell
python manage.py makemigrations app_manager
```

Migrate the data.
```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Create accounts table.
```shell
python manage.py migrate account
```

Load default User.
```shell
python manage.py loaddata sample_admin.json
```

Load default oauth apps so that you will be able to authenticate with defined external server.
```shell
python manage.py loaddata default_oauth_apps.json
```

Load default Initial Data for Cartoivew.
```shell
python manage.py loaddata initial_data.json
```

Load default Cartoview Appstore data.
```shell
python manage.py loaddata app_stores.json
```

!!! note
    After executing the above commands, you can ``exit`` the container terminal by just typing exit then hit the ``Enter`` button.
    
Restart the services running on docker so that the changes takes effect.

```shell
docker-compose restart
```

- **Test the development server**

***

In the browser navigate to ``localhost:80``. 

**For Windows:**

Open Docker Dashboard and for ``cartoview_nginx_1``container, click on ``Open in browser`` button to open Cartoview in the browser.

![Cartoview open browser](../img/installation/Docker/cartoview_browser.PNG)

You should get:

![Cartoview on Browser](../img/installation/Ubuntu/cartoview.png)

**Sign-in with:**
```shell
user: admin
password: admin
```

**For GeoServer:**
Open ``localhost:80/geoserver``

![GeoServer](../img/installation/Ubuntu/geoserver.png "GeoServer")
**Sign-in with:**
```shell
user: admin
password: geoserver
```

## GeoServer Configuration

- **Optional | Change default GeoServer admin Password**

***

1. Login with GeoServer credentials that were mentioned above.

2. At the left-side menu, navigate to **Security** section and click on **Users, Groups, Rules**.

    ![GeoServer Configuration](../img/installation/Docker/geoserver_pass1.png "GeoServer Configuration")

3. Click on **Users/Groups** then select **admin**.

    ![GeoServer Configuration](../img/installation/Docker/geoserver_pass2.png "GeoServer Configuration")
    
4. Set the password you wish then scroll to the end of the page and click **Save**.

    ![GeoServer Configuration](../img/installation/Docker/geoserver_pass3.png "GeoServer Configuration")
    
Now, you can logout and login again with the new password you have just entered.

- **Configure GeoServer with Cartoview**

***

In order for Cartoview to work properly, we need to authenticate GeoServer with it.

1. Inside ``cartoview`` directory, navigate to ``env`` folder and open the file called **celery.env**.

    Edit the contents of the file as below:
    
    ``GEOSERVER_PUBLIC_LOCATION=http://localhost/geoserver/ instead of http://10.5.0.4/geoserver/.``
    ``SITEURL=http://localhost/ instead of http://10.5.0.4/.``
    
2. Repeat step 1, but for another file which is **django.env**.

!!! note
    For **Docker Toolbox**, use docker IP address ``192.168.99.100`` instead of using ``localhost``.

3. For GeoServer, at the left-side menu, navigate to **Security** section and click on **Authentication**.

    ![GeoServer Configuration](../img/installation/Docker/geoserver_conf1.png "GeoServer Configuration")
    
    At the Authentication Filters, select **geonode-oauth2**.
    
    ![GeoServer Configuration](../img/installation/Docker/geoserver_conf2.png "GeoServer Configuration")
    
    Change the URLs inside the red square to the values in the image then click **Save**.
    
    ![GeoServer Configuration](../img/installation/Docker/geoserver_conf3.png "GeoServer Configuration")
    
4. At the left-side menu, navigate to **Security** section and click on **Users, Groups, Rules**.

    Click on **geonode REST role service**. 
    
    Select **ROLE_ADMIN** for **Administrator role** and **Group administrator role**.
    
    Edit the **Base Server URL**
    
    ![GeoServer Configuration](../img/installation/Docker/geoserver_conf4.png "GeoServer Configuration")
    
5. At the left-side menu, navigate to **Settings** section and click on **Global**.

    Edit the **Proxy Base URL**.

    ![GeoServer Configuration](../img/installation/Docker/geoserver_conf5.png "GeoServer Configuration")

6. Add **GeoServer OAuth2 Redirect URIs** accordingly.

    Open ``Cartoview Admin Dashboard`` in the browser at ``localhost/admin``.
    
    Navigate to this directory, ``Home › Django OAuth Toolkit › Applications › GeoServer``.
    
    Make sure GeoServer URLs are like the image below then click **Save**.
    
    ![Cartoview Configuration](../img/installation/Docker/cartoview_admin.png "OAuth Configuration")

**Verify the process of authentication between GeoServer and Cartoview**

Sign out from GeoServer and navigate to Cartoview at ``localhost``.

Login in Cartoview with the credentials:
```shell
user: admin
password: admin
```

Open GeoServer from the **admin dropdown**.

![GeoServer Configuration](../img/installation/Docker/geoserver_admin.png "GeoServer Configuration")

You should find that GeoServer user is logged in automatically, and the authentication process runs properly.


## Deployment Notes

Once Cartoview is installed it is expected to install all the Apps from the app store automatically, but Cartoview will not be able to restart Docker when new apps are installed. So, after installing any new app or app update, you will need to restart docker manually until this issue is addressed in the future.

**Follow these steps to get the apps working on Nginx:**

!!! note
    We need to open the terminal inside Cartoview container as we did at **Migrate & load default data** section.

- Collect static files using the command, ``python manage.py collectstatic --noinput``.

- Restart docker to see the change's effect, ``docker-compose restart``.
